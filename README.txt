SpaceLabs adds a ContractConfigurator REQUIREMENT type that attempts to filter unlocked parts for those suitable for space station cores.

Installation
============
Manual: Download a release from GitHub or SpaceDock, unzip it, and merge the GameData fodler with the game's GameData.
Automatic: Just use CKAN.

Dependencies
============
ContractConfigurator

Recommended
===========
Bases and Stations Reborn, a contract mod that SpaceLabs was designed to mesh well with, as no contract type is provided by SpaceLabs itself.

Known Issues
============
SpaceLabs filters parts based on their internal name, and so far only SSPX and the stock Hitchhiker can will trigger it. Ideas for more general 
filter criteria are welcome.
